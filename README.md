# HealthAssisto

Idea: We are working on a web app. It will have multiple functions namely: geting the location and navigation to the nearby hospitals and medical stores, send an SOS to your family members if you accidentally fall ill as well as to the nearby hospitals to get immediate medical attention. A bot to ascertain your mental health and discuss your problems with an open community of doctors and counsellors. You can also seek personal video consultation with a nominal fee.
